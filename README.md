## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first CSS framework

### What I learned

Completing this project has allowed me to begin learning the basics of using a utility-first approach to styling by using the Tailwind CSS framework.

### Continued development

Going forward I will continue learning about the utility-first approach to design by implementing Tailwind CSS into my projects. This will allow me to become more confident and proficient at executing the desired look for a project.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - This helped me to get set up and start using a utility-first approach to completing this project.
